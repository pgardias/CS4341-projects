This repository is a collection of AI algorithm implementations for the games Connect 4 and Bomberman.

The Bomberman AI uses both expectimax and Q-learning for different scenarios and versions (stages). The included weights are optimal for running Q-learning for each scenario and version combination. To run the Bomberman AI, reference the README nested in the Bomberman directory.

The Connect-N AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. To the run the Connect-N AI, simply execute `run.py` with the included game customization or create your own.
